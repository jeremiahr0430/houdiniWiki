Notes

**Tops/PDG**

Work Item Expand:

expand current work items.
for example. you have 5 work items for opengl rop, and for each of them, there are 10 frames to render.
expand, and you'll get 50 work items.

Attribute from String:

This helps you parse a string and you'll get a 'split*' attrib

Attrib Rename:

rename and preserve an attrib *e.g. the above 'split' attrib

ImageMagick and ffmpeg:

Download them from offitial website or github 
Install ImageMagick, and you'll get system path set automatically, and houdini can find it without opening another session.
ffmpeg comes as a file structure. find the exe file in bin dir and copy paste it to FFmpeg Binary Path parameter at the bottom of this top
